   POLYBIUS: Polybius is an urban 
   legend concerning a fictitious 
   1981 arcade game. The legend 
   describes the game as part of a 
   government-run crowdsourced 
   psychology experiment based in 
   Portland, Oregon. Gameplay 
   supposedly produced intense 
   psychoactive and addictive 
   effects in the player. These 
   few publicly staged arcade 
   machines were said to have been 
   visited periodically by men in 
   black for the purpose of data-mining 
   the machines and analyzing 
   these effects. 
   Allegedly, all of these Polybius 
   arcade machines disappeared 
   from the arcade market.

   Here is a tribute to the legend!
